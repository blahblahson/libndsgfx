RAW16 IMAGE FORMAT
__________________

RAW16 is the format used. It is a 16bit representation with straightforward
parameters for fast loading and blitting.


STRUCTURE

The dimensions of the image are simply two width and height variables. The two
are stored as unsigned 32bit integers at the beginning of the file, width then
height. 32bit allows for a theoretical limit of 0xffffffff by 0xffffffff
dimensions (4294967295x4294967295), or 18446744065119617025 pixels. That is
quite enough pixels.

Directly following the dimensions is the image data. It begins at the top left
of the image and continues in a left-to-right, up-to-down manner as English
does. The y dimension is implicit, so no delimiter is needed. Each pixel is
represented by a 16 bit value in the form ABBBBBGGGGGRRRRR. The alpha bit
toggles transparency or not in the layer. This is the format of DS screen
buffers, so it's easy to blit with minimum processing when loading into memory.

So the structure then looks something like (per byte):
    WWWWHHHHAABBCC...
W = width, H = height, A,B,C = pixels (0,0), (1,0) and (2,0) respectively

There is no item signifying the end of the file because it could just mean
another pixel (all values are allowed). The image should be read up to 2*w*h+8
(the +8 for w/h) bytes, no more no less. If the file ends before that then some
of the image will not be there.
